0.0.4 (unreleased)
------------------

- Windows: ``consistent_hash`` make the return value an ``int``

0.0.3 (2008-12-03)
------------------

- Refined the seed generation further: zlib.crc32() in 32 bit Python can
  generate negative hashes, while 64 bit Python does not.  Enforced
  positive hashes.

- Began a test suite.


0.0.2 (2008-12-02)
------------------

- Use the crc32 function to hash random seeds so that the
  same random sequences are generated on both 32 bit and 64 bit
  builds of Python.


0.0.1 (2008-02-14)
------------------

- Initial Release
